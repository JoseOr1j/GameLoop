# GameLoop
Designed and created by: Jose Orozco. 
Purpose: A Looping Game, created: 12/23/19
RULES AND MECHANICS: A game in where the user has to input two values one smaller and the other bigger.
The smaller value will be multiplied by 2 every turn (loop) and the bigger value will be incremented by
1 every turn (loop). The smaller value must be initially smaller in order to properly play, examples like:
(s -> smaller, b -> bigger) (s,b) -> (2,0) Results in an automatic win.
(0,100) Results in a longer lasting game.

Although the game can be easily won by putting a small value for the bigger value, there is no fun in doing that!
