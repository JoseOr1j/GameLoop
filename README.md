# GameLoop
A game in where the user inputs two values for integers "i" and "j" and plays a game in where i and j loop around.
MECHANICS AND RULES:
 While i is less than j then the loop will state the values of i and j. 
 j is being incremented by one, while i is being multiplied by 2.
 The point of the game is to catch up to the value of j to 
 become an awesome player, although you can put close numbers such as (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), there is no fun in putting small numbers, 
 go big for j and see how fast i catches up!
